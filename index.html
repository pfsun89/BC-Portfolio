        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a full-time student working full time as a warehouse associate. I&apos;m taking classes at Bellevue College to learn about web development, and I&apos;m planning on earning a Certificate of Accomplishment in Web Content Management. As for work experience, I have been a warehouse associate for almost 8 years at the time of writing this. My main responsibility was to pick and pack customer orders efficiently with decent pack quality. Eventually, I learned more about the computer system used to manage orders and communicated with managers, coworkers, and drivers to make sure that customer orders contained all desired items with no damages and were shipped out on time. Unfortunately, I&apos;m still a beginner in coding and have a lot of things to figure out.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to change careers from manual labor to one that is technical and more related to computers. After getting injured multiple times and slowly burning out, it seemed as though I have already reached my peak at my current job, and I have no interest in moving up. So, now I am looking for a career that falls more along the lines of problem-solving.</p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, my greatest weaknesses included communicating and interacting with others. As a result, I went through life preferring to be on my own. One activity that allowed me to remain in my comfort zone and still be entertained was playing video games. However, I’m also not very competitive. I just don’t like comparing myself to others or being placed in some kind of ranking system. So, I prefer games that have single player modes as well as good storylines and character customization features.</p>
        <p>I have also recently become interested in art and learning. Similarly to gaming, drawing and reading give me the freedom to do my own thing without any awkward encounters with people. I get to express myself and enjoy a good story or tutorial.</p>
        <p>Therefore, my main hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual Gaming</li>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
        </ul>

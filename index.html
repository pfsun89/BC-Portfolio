            <img src="assets/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
            <ul>
                <li>Warehouse Associate</li>
                <li>Bellevue, WA</li>

        <p>I am currently a full-time student working full time as a warehouse associate. I&apos;m taking classes at
            Bellevue College to learn about web development, and I&apos;m planning on earning a Certificate of
            Accomplishment in Web Content Management. As for work experience, I have been a warehouse associate for
            almost 8 years at the time of writing this. My main responsibility was to pick and pack customer orders
            efficiently with decent pack quality. Eventually, I learned more about the computer system used to manage
            orders and communicated with managers, coworkers, and drivers to make sure that customer orders contained
            all desired items with no damages and were shipped out on time. Unfortunately, I&apos;m still a beginner in
            coding and have a lot of things to figure out.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to change careers from manual labor to one that is technical and more related to computers.
            After getting injured multiple times and slowly burning out, it seemed as though I have already reached my
            peak at my current job, and I have no interest in moving up. So, now I am looking for a career that falls
            more along the lines of problem-solving.</p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, my greatest weaknesses included communicating and interacting with others. As
            a result, I went through life preferring to be on my own. One activity that allowed me to remain in my
            comfort zone and still be entertained was playing video games. However, I&apos;m also not very competitive.
            I just don&apos;t like comparing myself to others or being placed in some kind of ranking system. So, I
            prefer games that have single player modes as well as good storylines and character customization features.
        </p>
        <p>I have also recently become interested in art and learning. Similarly to gaming, drawing and reading give me
            the freedom to do my own thing without any awkward encounters with people. I get to express myself and enjoy
            a good story or tutorial.</p>
        <p>Therefore, my main hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual Gaming</li>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Three of the Most Important Concepts I have Learned in BATECH 189</h2>
        <h3>Preparing and Planning a Website</h3>
        <p>We all know that good practice and hands-on experience can help us improve our skills and become the best we
            can be at what we do, but when working on a long-term project, it may be a good idea to incorporate a
            planning phase into the process. Planning allows coders to develop a strategy and figure out things like
            outlines and goals. The purpose is to flesh out a vision, develop a roadmap, and recognizing or predicting
            possible obstacles.</p>

        </figure>
        <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>Semantic HTML is all about the syntax. It&apos;s used for defining sections or chunks of content for web
            pages. This facilitates the maintenance and interpretation of the author&apos;s content. At a first glance,
            this may seem a bit boring, but it&apos;s important to understand the basics and fundamentals before getting
            fancy..</p>

                height="720"></iframe>
        </figure>
        <h3>User Experience</h3>
        <p>The main idea of user experience is to think about using the web page from the target audience&apos;s
            perspective. Goals can include maximizing the positivity and meaningfulness of a user&apos;s visit to
            establish potential customer loyalty, and improving the users&apos; engagement with the website. Both
            website functionality and presentation play important roles. Gaining popularity and getting visitors to want
            to use the website are two halves of a decent plan for businesses to improve their credibility and earn the
            trust of their clients.</p>

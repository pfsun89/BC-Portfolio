                        work on more coding projects. The main purpose is to practice writing HTML code, become more
                        familiar with HTML structure and tags, and display some information about me. Though I did add
                        some CSS for fun.</p>

                        page and showcase 5 games I have some experience in. I will include an image, title, and
                        description for each game. At the top, I will include the title of the page and a few links to
                        navigate to each corresponding game on the page.</p>

        <h2>Three Important Concepts</h2>
        <h3 class="concepts">Preparing and Planning a Website</h3>
        <p>We all know that good practice and hands-on experience can help us improve our skills and become the best we
            can be at what we do, but when working on a long-term project, it may be a good idea to incorporate a
            planning phase into the process. Planning allows coders to develop a strategy and figure out things like
            outlines and goals. The purpose is to flesh out a vision, develop a roadmap, and recognizing or predicting
            possible obstacles.</p>

                height="720"></iframe>
        </figure>
        <h3 class="concepts">Semantic HTML</h3>
        <p>Semantic HTML is all about the syntax. It&apos;s used for defining sections or chunks of content for web
            pages. This facilitates the maintenance and interpretation of the author&apos;s content. At a first glance,
            this may seem a bit boring, but it&apos;s important to understand the basics and fundamentals before getting
            fancy..</p>

                height="720"></iframe>
        </figure>
        <h3 class="concepts">User Experience</h3>
        <p>The main idea of user experience is to think about using the web page from the target audience&apos;s
            perspective. Goals can include maximizing the positivity and meaningfulness of a user&apos;s visit to
            establish potential customer loyalty, and improving the users&apos; engagement with the website. Both
            website functionality and presentation play important roles. Gaining popularity and getting visitors to want
            to use the website are two halves of a decent plan for businesses to improve their credibility and earn the
            trust of their clients.</p>
